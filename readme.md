# Secure Password Generator

Thank you for your interest in the " Secure Password Generator". This works by allowing the user to select which criteria best suits their needs. The user is allowed to select between a randomized selection of characters that include lower case, upper case, special characters, and numbers. The user can manually enter 8-218 characters. Number will default to 8 characters if user chooses less than 8. Number will default to 128 if user chooses a number greater than 128 characters.
